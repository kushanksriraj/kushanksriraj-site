        <p>
            I have always tried to skip the section 'Choose a license' while creating a repository on Github. Well, that
            doesn't count under best practices. Not anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's not very important to put a license if you wish to create a private repo. However, if your repo is
            public (in most cases, it is), understanding the license part will definitely give you an upper edge in the
            open-source community.
        </p>

        <h3>Why licenses in softwares?</h3>

        <p>
            Softwares are generally classified into two groups: proprietary and open-source. And to protect the
            copyright of the individual/company who wrote it, licenses are needed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Proprietary softwares have licenses that are legally complex. Therefore, we will learn about licenses that
            are mostly used in open-source softwares only.
        </p>

        <h3>MIT License</h3>

        <p>
            This is the most popular license used for open-source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Under this licence, the person having a copy of this software (or simply your public repo) gets the rights
            to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell it's copies. Yeah, all of them!
        </p>
        <p>
            The author or the copyright holder (meaning you if you have a public repo) is not liable for any claim or
            damages that could possibly occur from the software. The idea is to protect the author from any damages
            whatsoever.
        </p>
        <p>
            The only requirement for this licence is that the copyright notice and permission notice given in the
            license should be included in all the copies of the software. This is done by putting the license in the
            License.txt file and keeping it in the root of the project.
        </p>

        <h3>APACHE License v2.0</h3>

        <p>
            This license grants the author a patent on his software. Other than that, it's mostly similar to MIT
            license.
        </p>
        <p>
            The license states : "... software distributed under the License is distributed on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT
            WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied."
        </p>
        <p>
            Hence, the author is not liable for any damages.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is required to put the license in every copy of the software.
        </p>

        <h3>GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3)</h3>

        <p>
            It states that: "Source code must be made available when the software is distributed."
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, If a person modifies the software, (s)he has to indicate changes made to the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similar to the other two, this licence also frees the author from any liability or damages inflicted by
            using the software.
        </p>
        <p>
            Interestingly, you can use this license for commercial purposes also. But, even then you have to keep the
            whole code base open-sourced.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <p>
            Well that's all you need to know about licenses while working with open-source projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recommend adding the MIT license to one of your public repo. You know, follow best practices!
        </p>
        <p>
            I appreciate your patience for reading this relatively boring piece. Hats off to you!
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I've gotta code.
        </p>
        <p>
            <small><strong>console.log("Bye..");</strong></small>
        </p>
        <p>
            <small><strong>process.exit(0);</strong></small>
        </p>
